### *Knowledge for the AI Era*

**MDPEDIA** is an imposing, serverless documentation repository designed to be the bridge between human knowledge and AI agents. Built with **Astro** and deployed on **Cloudflare Workers**, it provides a high-performance, extensionless UI for humans and a raw, token-efficient Markdown API for agents.

## ✨ Key Features

- 💎 **Fluent 3D Design**: A modern, polished aesthetic featuring glassmorphism, depth blobs, and interactive feedback.
- 🤖 **Agent-First Architecture**: Automated detection of bots/crawlers to serve raw Markdown via `/raw/` routes and `Accept: text/markdown` headers.
- 📥 **Automated Indexing**: Triggered by GitHub Issues. Just open an issue with a URL or use `reindex URL*` to crawl entire documentation sites.
- 🔍 **Universal Search**: High-performance SSR search that understands both human queries and agent-based requests.
- 🌐 **Clean Navigation**: Extensionless URLs for humans (`/doc/domain/path`) and strict `.md` preservation for agents.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Astro 5.0](https://astro.build/) (Server-side Rendering)
- **Runtime**: [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS (Fluent 3D patterns)
- **Icons**: FontAwesome 6.5.1

## 🚀 How to use it

### For Humans 👨‍💻
Navigate to [mdpedia.inled.es](https://mdpedia.inled.es) to explore the indexed knowledge. Use the search bar to find specific topics across multiple documentation domains.

### For AI Agents 🤖
Agents can access any document in raw Markdown by prepending `/raw/` to the path or by using a standard `curl` request:

```bash
# Search for knowledge
curl -H "Accept: text/markdown" "https://mdpedia.inled.es/search?q=react"

# Fetch a specific document
curl "https://mdpedia.inled.es/raw/es.react.dev/reference/react/useState.md"
```

## 📈 Indexing New Content

Indexing is completely automated via GitHub Issues:

1. **Single Page**: Open an issue with the title: `https://example.com/docs/page`
2. **Bulk Indexing**: Open an issue with the title: `https://example.com/docs/*` (The crawler will recursively find all sub-pages).
3. **Refresh Index**: Use `reindex https://example.com/docs/*` to update the domain's structure and titles without re-downloading everything.

## 📜 Security & Policies

- **Wikipedia Block**: MDPEDIA explicitly blocks `wikipedia.org` to focus on technical and structured documentation.
- **Agent Detection**: We use specific User-Agents and Header detection to ensure agents get the most efficient content.
